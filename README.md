# liwc-22-cli-python
 
 This is just an example script that shows a few different ways of running LIWC-22 from its Command Line Interface (CLI). The examples in this script are all the traditional LIWC-style word counting approach. However, the --help parameter in the LIWC-22 CLI is incredibly helpful and provides full documentation on how to conduct other types of LIWC-22 analyses (for example, Narrative Arc, Meaning Extraction) as well.
